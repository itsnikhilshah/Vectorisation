Eight men have been arrested and one charged following Manchester United's FA Cup quarter-final tie against Liverpool at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.

Supporters were arrested in connection with a range of suspected offences, including possession of class A drugs, causing intentional harassment, alarm or distress through chanting, and a racially aggravated public order offence.

It came during a match that saw United eventually beat Liverpool 4-3 after extra time thanks to a last-gasp winner.

There were 72,000 fans in attendance and of the eight men arrested, five were Liverpool fans and three were United fans.

George Fenning, from Edinburgh, was also charged with possession of a pyrotechnic, class B drugs, and throwing missiles. He has since been bailed.

Chief Inspector Jamie Collins, silver commander for the match, said: "I would like to thank the vast majority of supporters who came along to enjoy what turned out to be an intense game right to the very last minute.

"Thanks as well to all our officers and partners involved in the operation yesterday who contributed to what was a fantastic FA Cup tie.

"The arrests made were the result of us taking a proactive, zero-tolerance approach to ensure that genuine supporters and spectators were able to enjoy the match safely.

"Greater Manchester Police (GMP) can confirm that a 21-year-old man was arrested in connection with tragedy chanting. Incidents of tragedy chanting will not be tolerated and will be dealt with robustly."

He added: "We held a supporter group meeting with both sets of fans prior to the match and both groups agreed that tragedy chanting was totally unacceptable. GMP will clamp down on this and arrest those who engage in such behaviour, regardless of what team they support.

"We are also aware of footage circulating on social media of a Manchester United supporter engaging in tragedy chanting. No arrest has been made yet but GMP are working with both clubs to identify the individual in connection with this incident.

"I hope that these arrests will act as a deterrent to anyone attending future games."

In a news release, GMP said Manchester United supporters aged 21 and 59 were arrested on suspicion of causing intentional harassment, alarm or distress through chanting.

On Sunday, the FA issued a statement related to alleged "tragedy chanting" during the fixture.

It said it "strongly" condemns "any offensive, abusive and discriminatory chants in football stadiums, and we are determined to stamp this behaviour out".

The Premier League, which reposted the FA's statement, added on X: "There is no place for football tragedy abuse in our game.

"We strongly condemn this behaviour and sanctions are in place to ensure anybody found guilty faces consequences. The Premier League, The FA and EFL encourage fans to show support in positive ways to ensure matches are safe and enjoyable."

The Reds exited the tournament as a late goal from Amad Diallo condemned them to a loss in extra-time, ending hopes of another Wembley appearance this season.

They had looked on course to reach the last four when Alexis Mac Allister and Mohamed Salah struck in the first half to overturn Scott McTominay’s opener.

However, Antony came off the bench to roll in a late equaliser in normal time. Harvey Elliott then restored the visitors’ lead with a deflected shot, but Marcus Rashford levelled and Amad netted in the 120th minute to decide the tie.

Read on to see everything Klopp had to say in his post-match press conference at Old Trafford.

On what he takes from Liverpool’s performance…

Obviously today was on and above the edge, it was really tough for us with the 130 or whatever minutes. United had the clear best start, it was obvious, they scored the early goal. We had to organise ourselves a little bit better, we struggled with the man-marking, didn’t play enough, all these kinds of things. In the moment when we found for the first time a way to play then we get rhythm and then it looked really good. Then we were absolutely deserved 2-1 up. And second half was exceptional, absolutely exceptional what we played here.

But we didn’t finish the game off and when you leave the door open away from home at Old Trafford, it’s clear they will get chances. They could score the equaliser and Marcus big chance at the end of normal time, so they can win it there. I see that, it’s clear. Then it got really hard for us, then it was really hard for us. That was now the first time that I really saw my team struggling, that’s how it is. We played a lot of football recently.

Then we go 3-2 up, all good. Then they score, 3-3, 4-3. Come on, easily can accept that, congratulations to United, they fought extremely hard as well. That’s how it is, you want to go to the semi-finals. I think everybody who saw the game today saw two teams who both understood the importance of the occasion and the competition. We tried absolutely everything. Today we didn’t get a lot for it, not to say nothing.

So, now the boys have to recover, it’s really tough – they fly now all around the world pretty much and in five or six days’ time play the first of two games. Let’s really hope and pray they come all back healthy and then we will start the rest of the season. So many good things I saw today. The mood today, when you think about in general the game without being Liverpool and Man United, you think, OK, that was quite some football. And that’s exactly how it should be. I’m happy with that part. Not with the result obviously.

On whether the ‘draining nature’ of the emotions of a game like this are part of why he is leaving at the end of the season, or if they are part of ‘the addiction’ to the job…

Neither, nor – nothing to do with that. If you see me watching football for a team I like, quite emotional as well. So you can have that as well without being in the dugout. Didn’t think about that, it’s other things. We can talk about my situation as long as you want, I just can’t change my answers, to be honest. When you are winning that [the touchline] is a great position to watch a game; when you are losing it’s pretty much the worst, you stand there. That’s how it is. It’s all fine, I had that all often enough, I don’t know exactly how many games I had now as a manager but I had that quite a few times. It’s nothing to do with that, [like] if we win a game then I want to stay manager, if we lose a game I don’t want to stay manager. [Or] if the atmosphere is great I want to be manager, if the atmosphere is not good I want to leave.

It’s a general decision about something which has nothing to do with these little moments or whatever. I am really sorry if I cannot explain it properly enough. Maybe I have to say it in German and you can all translate it! I’m not sure that will be better, by the way! Nobody has to worry about anything. It’s not that I say, oh my God, that’s so great. I love absolutely everything about the things I do. But I need to be on my top game to do it like I do it. If I feel I am not there then I am not the manager I have to be anymore. That’s how it is. Then you are not only a little bit worse, you are then immediately properly worse and then you are in the wrong place. If you can see that early, you make a decision.

On saying the team was ‘struggling’ and whether that was because of the amount of games they are playing…

Yeah. The problem is we didn’t even know who to take off. For a while it was alright, in 90 minutes everything would have been fine. But then with extra-time, it was like options were now not [there]. We can talk now we bring the kids – we all said that all the time, you have to bring them in the right moment. They are fantastic but it was not the right moment. You just saw, we could have [taken off] Macca definitely, Wataru [Endo] definitely, Darwin [Nunez] definitely, Lucho [Diaz] we did then, Joey [Gomez]. They play all the time the boys and today, this extra-time.

Let me say, if you lose then lose in normal time but not extra-time and then losing that late. That’s obviously close to get the penalty shootout. That would have been the same intensity if we don’t concede the last two goals, but the way we conceded the last two goals you can see as well, obviously we were not on top of our game anymore, gave two balls away. Absolutely no criticism about that. I saw a team who understood the importance of the game and gave absolutely everything. Today it was not enough and that’s what we have to accept now.

On whether there’ll be a psychological impact given the manner of today’s defeat...

No. Wow, you lose a quarter-final in the FA Cup and if there was a mental drain it would be really difficult if we have to deal with human beings like that. We’ve played football for ages and you lose games – if that always leads to a mental state or situation where you need help... it’s just a normal thing. We all fail on a daily basis, maybe without even recognising it – we just get along with it. Today, if you don’t give all then it’s not mentally [draining], but you have to react on it and the rest is [something] we are used to unfortunately since we were kids that from time to time we lose a football game.

I got the question already before, what kind of reaction I expect now? Nothing, they go to their countries and I hope they come back and have nothing [injuries] and then we think about Brighton when they come back and we know who can play again and that will be tricky enough. In general, the team is in an outstanding situation in the moment. That we got through all of these different, difficult situations is absolutely exceptional. For today, we could have won the game and we would have deserved it, but we lost it and Man United deserved it as well. That’s the situation.

On whether the international break ‘comes at a good time’ for Liverpool...

I am not exactly sure when they play the first games. I think probably Thursday or Friday, something like that, so until then it should be fine. I think most of them have friendlies, Wataru I think has qualifiers. Can I make this decision for the managers? Most of them don’t speak the same language and I have no contact. They want them as well in the best possible shape in the summer, so most of them play either Copa or Euros.

So, I hope they don’t have to play now two games [of] 90 minutes and stuff like this, that would be helpful, but it is not in my hands. Does it come in the right moment? If we were playing and the next game would be on Thursday or Friday I would be fine with that as well. It’s never cool when they are not around, I like it a lot when they are here and we can really give players a day off and just treatment and stuff like this. But it is not the first time like this, it is the last time like that [of his time at Liverpool]. Let’s just hope they come back in a good shape and then we go.

There were moments during that period of extra time before Amad Diallo’s winner, as the atmosphere inside Old Trafford sparked and crackled like it rarely has in recent years, when it was not entirely clear what formation Manchester United were supposed to be playing.

There was no recognised centre-forward, for starters. Only two United players would call themselves defenders. A right-winger was playing at left-back. Bruno Fernandes was limping around at centre-half.

Erik ten Hag has been regularly criticised this season for lacking a defined style of play and now, United did not even appear to be playing a coherent system — just look at the average positions of Ten Hag’s starting XI in the pass network below.

But rather than focusing only on those final, desperate and thrilling minutes of extra time, take this extraordinary FA Cup quarter-final as a whole and it might be the best example yet of exactly what Ten Hag is trying to achieve.

What is United’s style of play? This is United’s style of play. It is fast, it is direct, it is supposed to be full of intensity. At its worst, it can be so chaotic as to be calamitous. At its best, it has all the most exhilarating qualities associated with English football and is capable of producing an instant classic.

And curiously, it is not all that different from Liverpool’s. No team in the Premier League has made more Opta-defined ‘direct attacks’ than United’s 72 this season. Their closest challengers? Liverpool, with 71. When United go forward, they fly up the pitch at an average of 1.92 metres per second, only a shade quicker than Liverpool’s 1.89.

Chart the speed of United’s attacks against the number of passes they play in each sequence of possession, then compare across the whole of the top flight, and Ten Hag’s side come out almost right in line with Liverpool. A little less intricate, but just as direct.

All of which is a slightly convoluted way of demonstrating something that is not obvious to the naked eye, but that not one of the 74,000-plus inside Old Trafford could deny after 124 minutes of play: that United are capable of playing Liverpool at their own game. Capable of beating them at it, too.

Not that they are perfect, nor even remotely close to being equal to Jurgen Klopp’s title challengers consistently. Despite the similarities in how they attack, United still have much to improve when it comes to defending.

Ten Hag recently took exception to Jamie Carragher’s “subjective” Monday Night Football analysis of the gaps in United’s midfield in the defeat to Fulham last month — but after Scott McTominay’s opener and right up until Antony’s equaliser, United only served to reinforce Carragher’s point.

Vast expanses of space opened up in Ten Hag’s midfield, just as they had on the touchscreen in the Sky Sports studio.

Whereas Liverpool have perfected the art of counter-pressing, United’s ambitious attempts to win the ball high up the pitch that had largely worked early on began to flounder, leaving a front six high and dry and a back four scrambling in retreat.

Klopp’s side expertly exploited these gaps — literal and metaphorical gulfs between these two sides — to put themselves back in front.

What would happen if United simply sat deep and closed those spaces off? We had the answer to that a fortnight ago at the Etihad when a team camped in and around their penalty box tried to make the most of the few opportunities that came their way — by and large, United were outclassed.

So, how do you play fast, direct and exciting football while still maintaining control? It is a balance Liverpool have largely perfected during Klopp’s eight and a half years in charge and one that Ten Hag has failed to strike over the past 18 months.

Maybe the only way to emerge from the chaos is to embrace it. Rather than sitting deep and being dominated as in the Manchester derby, United took risks, they pushed high, they committed players forward.

Liverpool are fully capable of controlling games, but they do not quite snuff the life out of an opponent in the same way as City. They will give you a chance, often more than one. Ten Hag bet that when those chances came, United would take them.

In his post-match press conference, Ten Hag spoke glowingly of the game as a whole, which he said was “really fun to be part of”, but he also referenced the opening 35 minutes and the final stages specifically.

The first 35 minutes was a spell that, in his opinion, represented the best of his United, proving “the future of this team is very bright”. “We have seen in the first 35 minutes how we wanted to win — how we played from the back, attract the opponent, find the half-spaces,” he said.

Then at the end, when many sides would have settled for a penalty shootout, he revealed he instructed his defence to go one-on-one with Liverpool’s attack, allowing others to push further up the pitch. That maybe explains the slightly confused, makeshift formation. But why do it?

“I saw we are physically and mentally strong,” he said. “I had to force (the players) to go forward, force the team to go one on one, then they are forced to help each other… from that moment, we got the initiative and had many chances.”

Ten Hag has made his fair share of questionable tactical decisions during his time in charge but, with a few notable exceptions, they have typically been brave ones. That was another courageous call and it paid off.

The question for Ten Hag is whether he will be given the time to keep taking such gambles. As we have seen this season, United often play too fast for their own good, too direct to maintain any level of control, and with an intensity that cannot always be maintained.

But United’s style of play is not a million miles away from one successfully adopted a few miles down the East Lancs Road. And when it works, it works brilliantly.
